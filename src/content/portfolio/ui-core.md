  [
    '- Using TSDX, Typescript, and Chakra UI, I solely maintained and developed an internal UI Library to eventually be used across all XQ products. It was implemented in the Vault application as well as parts of the management portal (Policy Manager/Secure Messaging section).',
    '- Worked 1 on 1 with our designer to create components/give insight to the provided Figma specifications.',
    '- I was eventually wanting to implement styles via Tailwind CSS for scalability/use outside of React-based projects, as Chakra UI depends on the React framework.',
